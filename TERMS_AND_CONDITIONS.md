## 1. Introduction
These Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("you" or the "User") and SocialSphere Technologies Inc.

If you are 17 and under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, your legal guardian should review these Terms with you.

## 3. Accounts and Security
1. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information when registering an account and keep that information up to date.  
2. You are responsible for safeguarding your credentials and all activities that occur under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized access or suspected breach.

## 9. Data Retention and Security
1. SocialSphere implements reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or disclosure.  
2. We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in these Terms and our Privacy Policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
