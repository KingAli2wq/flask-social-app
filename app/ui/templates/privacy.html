            <h2>What this covers</h2>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have when using SocialSphere.
                This policy applies to the web app, our APIs, and any related services.
            </p>

            <h2>Information we collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account information</strong> (such as username, email, and profile details you provide).</li>
                <li><strong>Content you create</strong> (posts, captions, messages, uploads, and other submissions).</li>
                <li><strong>Usage and device data</strong> (basic logs like timestamps, request metadata, and diagnostics to keep the service reliable).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How we use information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide and operate the app (authentication, delivering content, and maintaining features).</li>
                <li>Protect safety and integrity (abuse prevention, moderation, and enforcing rules).</li>
                <li>Improve reliability (debugging, performance monitoring, and quality improvements).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Sharing</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell your personal information.
                We may share information when required to operate the service (for example, infrastructure providers),
                to comply with legal obligations, or to protect users and the platform.
            </p>

            <h2>Retention</h2>
            <p>
                We keep data for as long as needed to provide the service and for legitimate operational, security, and legal purposes.
                You may delete content where the app provides that ability, and we may retain limited records for security and audit needs.
            </p>

            <h2>Your choices</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Update your profile information in settings.</li>
                <li>Control what you post and who can see it based on in-app visibility options (where available).</li>
                <li>Contact us to request access, correction, or deletion when applicable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                We use reasonable safeguards designed to protect information.
                No system is perfectly secure, so please use a strong password and keep your credentials private.
            </p>
